# dots-hyprland

Hey there!  

These are my personal **dotfiles** – configs for all the stuff I use on my Linux setup (Hyprland, terminal, apps, etc).  

> ⚠️ Heads up: these are made specifically for **my setup**, so they might break things if you just copy them blindly.  

Feel free to **borrow, or steal ideas**, but don’t expect them to work perfectly on your machine out of the box.

## What’s Inside
